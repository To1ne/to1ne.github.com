Most frameworks rely on class="end" or similar to remove the margin from the last column in a row of grids. We don't want to do that so we use a combination of margin- and negative margin-left. It's clever...
We also allow you to use grid items as stand alone columns or in a series of columns. To use a series just wrap them all in <div class="grids">...</div>

Here we are using an attribute selector to detect the string 'grid-' in an element's class.
This works by assuming that anything we call grid- we also want to be a grid item. It means less code and less for you to remember!

Ensure any grid item's FIRST class is a grid- class. e.g.
VALID: class="grid-4 text-centre"
INVALID: class="left grid-4"
